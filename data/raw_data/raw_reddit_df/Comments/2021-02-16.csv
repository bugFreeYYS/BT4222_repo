172,gnmwfy2,t1_gmvf3k9,"Paper wallets are an antiquated method of BTC storage/control.

Nowadays every wallet software (or hardware) you give you, upon creation of a fresh wallet, it's ""seed"". It's a list of 24 words (following the BIP39 standard), that you should store safely in a NON-ELECTRONIC medium (think paper, or maybe even better, metal, stone) and that allows for disaster recovery in case you lose access to the normal wallet (hard drive fails, etc.).

There are ways to make your private keys NEVER touch an online computer, and this may be of particular importance when your holdings are big enough (several thousands / 10s of thousands). The easiest way to achieve this goal is to use a hardware wallet. The hardware wallet will generate private keys inside of it, the keys will never leave the HW wallet itself.  Wallet software in your computer will ask the wallet to sign transactions and in this way you can spend your BTC, but you remove the possibility of attacks happening via vulnerabilities in your computer.",t3_krqrmf,2021-02-16 19:15:45,2021-02-16

Money. THE most important part of the economy is exogenous. Has no part to play.

There are heterdox alternative theories of economics such as Post-Keynesians which have developed models where money is endogenous to the economy (it actually plays a part).

If anyone asks you why things have gone haywire, point to the fact that all Universities and all Governments have based all their policies on the dominant Neoclassical School of Economics where MONEY plays no part in any of their models.

Woah woah.... Stop right there. Yes it does so long as the government is representative of the people. Different economies have different needs so flexible currencies allow counter cyclical policy which stabilizes economies.


What we are experiencing isn't an issue with the ability to apply monetary policy, rather, it is with how and why those policies are enacted. It's been almost exclusively for the financiers for over a century.

This is like saying music is bad because all you ever heard was crappy songs.

For example, tarrifs protected US manufacturing so that workers could enjoy better working conditions. NAFTA eliminated tarrifs so that financiers had a safe way to invest in foreign markets without protections insuring cheap products flooded in and destroyed our good jobs.

Some might say that since it has worked this way in the past, it will always work this way, but that isn't true. 

The process of decentralization will extend beyond finance. Soon we will have open protocols for exchanges, voting, social media etc. Therefore governance will also grow to more represent the people.

3265,gnl3mf6,t1_gnkwzca,">Someone please correct me if I am wrong here, but didn't blockchain tech originate from an unknown group of coders using a pseudonym? 

Bitcoin (and with it, what you call ""blockchain tech"") was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto, which is indeed a pseudonym. In theory, while this could have been a ""group of coders,"" this seems very unlikely given the stylistic consistency and technical focus of essentially all public correspondence made by the pseudonym, especially when you dig into the earliest collaborations Nakamoto made with other contributing developers and thinkers in the space.

>Wasn't the encryption algo designed by engineers working for the NSA?

It's unclear what you mean by ""encryption algo"" in this context, but Bitcoin's architecture incorporates a number of cryptographic algorithms, including SHA-256, RIPEMD-160, and ECDSA over the secp256k1 elliptic curve.

These algorithms are extensively-studied and well-understood, and crucially, open source, i.e. available for analysis by any and all interested parties. Frankly, if Bitcoin tried to use ""roll-your-own cryptography"" and were built out of algorithms that *weren't* scrutinized by agencies like the NSA, ***that*** would be a red flag, and reason for concern. When it comes to modern cryptography, you want algorithms that are public and vetted by as many smart and well-resourced entities as possible; otherwise, the risk of some esoteric vulnerability being discovered later on down the road would be much higher.

The whole point of how Bitcoin was released is that *it doesn't matter who developed or contributed to it*, because *the code speaks for itself*. While someone who doesn't understand software engineering or the mathematics of cryptography might not be qualified to evaluate the source code directly, plenty of people *do* understand these things, and since its launch, Bitcoin has grown into one of the most popular, heavily-scrutinized pieces of open source technology to ever exist.

And I must say  dishonesty is a thing I intensely dislike. It was a type which, in my  childhood in Austria, was described as Levantine, typical of the people  of the eastern Mediterranean. But I encountered it later, and I have a  profound dislike for the typical Indian students at the London School of  Economics, which I admit are all one type–Bengali moneylender sons.  They are to me a detestable type, I admit, but not with any racial  feeling. I have found a little of the same amongst the  Egyptians–basically a lack of honesty in them.""

The Dev team can't make unilateral changes without mining concensus either, so they don't own it. Anybody can start or stop mining, so there is no ownership there.

> Let me emphasize. I am an enormous admirer of Hayek, but not for his economics. That, again, is subject to misunderstanding. It depends on what you mean by economics. I’m not talking about his understanding of economics, his application of economics to the real world, or anything like that, but his contributions to the science of economics, not to economic practice, not to anything else. I think Prices and Production was a very flawed book. I think his capital theory book is unreadable. I cannot say I’ve read it. [laughter] It’s very unreadable.

>On the other hand, The Road to Serfdom is one of the great books of our time. His writings in [political theory] are magnificent, and I have nothing but great admiration for them. I really believe that he found his right vocation—his right specialization—with The Road to Serfdom. His earlier works were intended to be part of the literature of technical economics as a science, and, indeed, it was that characteristic of them that impressed Lionel Robbins and led Lionel to bring him from Austria to London.

In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts.

Isn't the goal of a market is to take concentrate as much market cap to yourself as possible? I doubt AnCaps support Anti-trust laws, no one's gonna enforce them.

AnCap is pure theory, parlor games/debate to justify some kind of unchecked greed and it's stupid, I think they're just entertaining themselves really.

 To me what happened to John Galton (of Anarcapulco fame) is the MOST AnCap story ever: He fled with his bitcoins to Acapulco, and started the Anarcapulco shindig. He had tons of money, he's named ""John Galton"" off John Galt from the Ayn Rand novels I gather. He escaped iirc including extradition over violating drug laws, which btw I know the war on drugs is a bunch bullshit, it's a war on our own citizens, I believe in Jury Nullification for all drug crimes outside of violent ones or horrible victimization against innocent parties.

Anyways...I'm sure he believed in free markets, and he decided for the ancap shindig, HE was going to be the main procurer of marijuana. The government/cartels let him exist unmolested, up til that crucial decision. Now he's stepping in on cartel territory. AFAIK, they're their own business model, the government is by and large ineffective at doing anything about them, like Biff Tannen in Alternate 1985, they OWN the police in that area, the one's to enforce the murder laws.

And they barged in his suite, shot and killed him, wounded his friend, his wife released a crying youtube video informing their audience what happened. To my knowledge no one ever really investigated or did anything about it.

To me, that is the MOST ancap story in practice. THat is where AnCap society would result, whoever's got the biggest, meanest, most armed gang, are going to use unchecked violence to get their way, NAP be damned (Non-Aggression Principle). Given the NAP, I think that's just some nice sounding addendum to sell their massively incompetent/malicious worldview to normies, who's gonna enforce the NAP, there's no real government, so i guess some kind of vigilante mob maybe, that's still very lawless. I don't see how it can possibly work.

3470,gnm30j7,t1_gnlkjtv,"Again, you seem to attribute problems of the State to the economic system.

>Why didn't the market squash The Atlantic Slave Trade before our government existed?

Because the market wasn't in charge of justice, the slave trade was protected by other States (mostly monarchic) back then. Neither capitalism nor socialism is to blame for the slave trade, only the authorities who enabled and fueled such practices are to blame because they were the ones in charge of justice.

>I look at the history of our imperialism in foreign country, especially S. and Central America.

Imperialism is directly tied to the government. First of all, let me say that a lot of cases of said ""imperialism"" are just companies putting factories in other countries because it is cheaper to manufacture there, this means more jobs for the people there, I don't see the problem there. The real problem of imperialism is when companies get away with special privileges like indiscriminate exploitation of resources, or inhumane unemployment conditions which are the direct responsibility of the country's government. Again, this is a problem of justice, not the economic system.

>our war with Mexico was a clash of empires and we seized the imitative when we held the upper hand.

All war conflicts are also the responsibility of the governments which start said conflicts, either for pure political matters or because of special interests. This happened with countries with capitalist economic systems as well as communists/socialists, same goes for imperialism.

>I think the market is entirely ok with making involuntary 3rd parties eat negative externalities without their consent.

That is a problem of definition and/or defense of your rights. You own your body and nobody should contaminate it without your consent, but you never see a court stopping a greedy company from polluting because they can just bribe them or get a special permit or whatever. The problem relies again on that if there's a monopoly on justice, it's easier to corrupt and nobody can stop it.

>There's clearly major problems going on, and ""corporations self-regulating"" or wutever you have in mind, will not deal with it...fundamentally so no less.

I have studied enough political economy to know that you don't need a central authority to keep companies in line for aggressing your individual rights. You just need a justice service, which, is best served in a free, competitive market. If you have any arguments to refute this statement it would be a nice topic cause here you just said: ""it won't work"".

>Because out the other side of the mouths of those ""pro-deregulation"" types, often enough they're not against militarized police and loosey goosey reasoning for deadly force, and often enough they're social authoritarians in favor of mass incarceration, that's fuck tons of government directed at the ordinary American.

I agree with you here completely. I'm not this type of person, I'm absolutely against any type of authoritarianism, either economic, cultural, or social. I'm also against mass incarceration. Most republicans or conservatives fill their mouths talking about freedom but they are actually bootlickers for the police force which incarcerates a lot of people for crimes without victims, a lot of them commit abuse of authority, simply because they are the only authority available and they can do whatever they want, that's why I see a market based on competition as the best solution to bringing security, a customary based security is a defensive, not aggressive, security.

>For me my knowledge of history, I think the market wants to dominate and allocate the resources/income/wealth/labor into the hands of a tiny pool of elites

This is just not true. I mean, it may look like so, but it's empirically incorrect. Before the industrial revolution (which started thanks to the implementation of modern capitalism) 90% of the world's population lived under extreme poverty, today is less than 15%. If the purpose of the market is to dominate everything into the hands of a tiny pool of elites then there would be more poverty now than there was before. I do agree that there are an elite amassing power and lots of capital and that is politicians (who obtain their revenue coercively) alongside crony corporations that get privileges like bailouts, subsidies, special treatment at judicial courts, etc. Which brings me to this:

>Maybe I'm influenced by Smedley Butler here:  
>  
>“I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.”

He is absolutely right and this proves my point. This guy literally worked for the government and did the dirtiest things for corporations that had special interests with politicians. And guess why they got away with it in foreign lands? Because the government of the United States exchanges favors with the local governments, and it forms a network of corruption. This can happen in any economic system simply because it is the way of the States.

The States started as a group of people colonizing other people, that's their thing, that's what they do. Today you are a slave of their legislations and you gotta do what they tell you to do. If they make you help in the raping of half a dozen Central American cities for Wall Street, you don't have a say in it, because they have the monopoly on force.

So, the economic system is not to blame here, all the ugly things about capitalism and socialism are directly tied to the practices of the governments, to the political means. Capitalism is just lots of people exchanging goods and services freely and voluntarily, there's nothing wrong with that. I do believe that we deserve justice, but I don't see that justice is different than your phone provider, or your streaming platform. Justice is just another service and we should treat it as such.
