31,grb0fwk,t3_m16uon,"Bitcoin haters, bow down.

The Elites are threatened now because they soon will be unable to make “Fees” or huge profits off of us. Every time we give the banks power to control our money, they have the power to charge us for our money. How many times did the bank charge you fees, or limit how much money you can take out of the ATM per day? How many times did you have to call the fraud department to tell them you actually tried to make a legit transaction?  How many times did you have to deal with an irritating bank employee? 

Taking the power back from the banks (and government) through Bitcoin. The banks, media, and Western Union hate it. They will bow down. The people have spoken.",t3_m16uon,2021-03-18 09:34:07,2021-03-18

90,grc9zoq,t3_m7jnz2,"What do we think BTC's absolute top will be? Personally i think once we hit $1m we are pretty close to the summit, Bitcoin will then be worth almost twice as much as gold which from a fundamentals standpoint makes sense in the event of mass adoption as a global currency. As Michael Saylor explained it performs the function of gold in transferring value over time but also solves the problem gold has of transferring it over space as well. In addition there is a near-infinite amount of gold located in outer space which will be mined to oblivion once we have the means to do so, which will pretty much render gold's function as a store of value obsolete anyway.

Even the S2F model breaks down after the 2028 halving by which only 1.56 BTC will be added to the supply every 10 minutes. By then I think we will be at or pretty close to mass worldwide adoption, volatility will decrease and we will see a much more stable asset that will have much more utility as a currency in everyday transactions.",t3_m7jnz2,2021-03-18 18:58:42,2021-03-18

The next phase will take time - more institutions will announce they buy BTC given that the Fed is predicting inflation - but this isn't 1000% given even though we believe ""it is inevitable"" , hence not yet priced in yet.  Once the inflation numbers actually come in showing higher inflation, BTC will again go up.

402,grcfb9e,t1_grc9zoq,"I think there are two forces driving Bitcoin price:

1. Bitcoin as a store of value infringing on classic stores of value like gold.  This will continue to drive price increases because of the rising volume of buyers from institutional sources.  But, yes, this should top out at some point as the investing world settles on the overall allocation of assets to Bitcoin.  Problem is that it is impossible to predict that point today.  It could be 1M.  It could be 10M.
2. Inflation of fiat currencies.  This drives the price of Bitcoin up, but it's really the deterioration of the value of the fiat side at play.  $$ (or whatever currency) falling in value (ie inflating....) means more $$ to buy a given amount of Bitcoin.  There is no real limit to increases from this factor.  We could inflate our way to a couple million a bitcoin or a trillion a bitcoin - or anywhere in between.  The key factor to keep in mind with inflation, though, is that all $$ prices will be rising for the same reason.  So that loaf of bread might cost $50 or $5000.  At some point it ceases to be relevant to talk about the price of bread in $$$ and instead talk about the price of final goods directly in BTC.",t3_m7jnz2,2021-03-18 20:00:33,2021-03-18

Then again, if the macro outlook continues on this path and we actually see Bitcoin continue to grow as a black hole and suck up the fixed income pools of capital. None of the retail selling points above might matter.

My personal view, is that we’ll definitely see a drawdown once this bull run is over but not in the 80-90%. I’m thinking 50-60% from the peak.

If you don't have a private key, you don't have Bitcoin.

If your bitcoins are held in a 3rd party hosted wallet, you don't have Bitcoin.

If your bitcoins are in a hybrid wallet and you have no wallet backup, you don't have Bitcoin.

If you don't know what kind of wallet your bitcoins are held in or whether you control the private keys, you don't have Bitcoin.

If you don't even remember which wallet your bitcoins are held in or where it is, and your plan is to contact the Bitcoin Corporation to tell you which wallet you've opened and restore everything for you, you don't have Bitcoin.

So I just chuck everything on my coinbase into my coinbase pro account. Of course, people will say to buy a ledger or put them in cold storage blah blah blah.

If you are sitting on a sizable gain, you’ll be subject to ST or LT capital gains tax. When you sell, gain is based on FIFO (First In First Out) so, if you’ve ever bought multiple lots like some do, the cost basis of the units sold is calculated on the first lots purchased. 

(a. Buy 1@$100)  (b. Buy 1@$120) (c. Buy 1@$150)
(d. Sell 1.5@$200)

Many people can't or don't want to learn a new thing. They don't want to worry about if they typed an address wrong or pushed too many buttons, or scanned the wrong thing. They are used to having an institution that can just fix what they messed up with a quick phone call. They are used to paying by swiping a card, and know that they paid when they signed. If there is fraud or misuse, they can get thier money back with just a simple form. So robinhood and PayPal are EXCELLENT, because they help bridge the gap on the way to decentralized currency for these people who otherwise would not adopt it. These institutions cannot give out private keys because the people they serve will get fleeced into giving them up. I know it goes againt the very nature of crypto to have an institution centrally control peoples wallets (if they are even wallets) However, many people will inevitably realize that they can pretty simply manage thier own wallets and payments, that these institutions are a less secure and less trustworthy way of using crypto, and will ultimately ditch PayPal or robinhood.",t3_m7bmr1,2021-03-18 11:30:09,2021-03-18

1534,grbvqnf,t1_grbbfb2,"Wallet is a confusing term, really. Even withdrawal is confusing. The coins never exist anywhere but on the blockchain. In the chain each coin is associated with an address. You never really “send” them anywhere when you make a transfer, you just have them reassigned to a new address. The point is that to generate the address and prove it’s your address (which allows you to make address reassignments - ie to send the coin to a new address, which is equivalent to making a transfer) you need the private keys for that address. So, basically, the private keys are a way for you to prove you own that address, hence the coins associated with it, so you and only you can “move” them. A wallet, then, is just a way to store the private keys, not the coins. 

All that said, moving back to more familiar language, CB will allow you to withdraw your coins. Therefore you’re fine with them c.f. Robinhood.

You will hear people say “not your keys, not your coins”. Recalling what I said above, that means, if anyone other than you knows your private keys then they can control your coins. Take CB as an example, when you go through their withdrawal process, behind the scenes *they* are using the private keys associated with your coins to send the coins to whatever address you tell them, for which you and only you know the private keys.

People have developed both software or hardware wallets that can store the private keys for you. But never use a “custodial wallet” ie one that keeps your keys and manages them for you, it’s no different to keeping them on an exchange. Only ever use one that works in such a way that only you has the private keys. A wallet can even a bit of paper with the keys written down / stamped bit of metal - you don’t necessarily need to use any other software/hardware!

Hopefully it obvious to you that that could be an issue because if they have your private keys then effectively they have control over your coins - and some people are really against that as they could suddenly refuse to let you have them and take ownership of your coins for whatever reason (or if someone hacks them - has been done). It’s a bit like putting your cash in a bank rather than keeping it at home yourself. 

Now, I would not always be so hardcore because the problem with managing them yourself is you really need to know what you’re doing as many people have lost their coins. So you really have a decision, do you trust yourself or CB less?!

Anyway, to summarise:

* never use a platform that doesn’t let you withdraw (or robinhood) as you’re not really buying coins you’re buying a promise that they’ll honour the price changes.
* CB does allow withdrawal so no panic for them
* decide whether you trust yourself or the platform to hold your private keys (hold your coins)",t3_m7bmr1,2021-03-18 15:29:08,2021-03-18

The reason Robinhood got 3 billion in funding was so they could meet clearinghouse requirements while being able to continue to filling buy orders. A clearinghouse is what exchanges the cash and securities between the buyer and seller. A clearinghouse needs a collateral from the buyers and sellers during the time it takes to transfer the cash and securities. The time it takes to transfer everything can take multiple days. This is what causes the most problems and confusion. Even though Robinhood shows your stocks or cash show up instantly when you hit the buy/sell button, they do not have the stock or cash yet. They are good for it, it’s just slow to transfer over. That’s why they use extra liquidity to make sure you get your money or stock instantly. This system works fine until there is higher than expected demand and volume. 

Robinhood was unprepared and they got caught in a bad situation where they were forced to limit trading. They don’t trade against their customers and do not have short/long positions.

 My background is risk management. I’m saying that RH did not meet the standards for responsible RM. I mean this in a very similar sense to how you’ve expressed that RH was unprepared. The difference between our sentiments seems to be relative to RH’s perceived capacity to be prepared. I know that RH has the resources and intelligence to meet their responsibility to provide adequate risk management, despite having failed to do so. 

 RH has direct control over the margin they keep. That margin did not need to be blown up to the point that their liquidity provider’s RM had to call it in. RH had multiple options to mitigate the magnitude of their margin and chose not to. The reasonable explanations for that decision are fairly limited. RH’s RM team should have been on top of this.

I believe that the evidence best supports RH having acted in a rational, unethical manner. I believe that RH allowed an excessive order volume to fulfillment ratio because they believed they could stand to benefit, or at least afford to risk, delayed fulfillment.

It blows me away that anyone would buy bitcoin or any other coin and not learn what it means to have their keys and put some into a hard wallet. 

If something happens to the U.S. dollar and the s\*\*t hits the fan (big if, I know), so many rich people will be scrambling at the very last second, both they and their banks leveraged up to their eyeballs with no idea how to access their crypto and GTFO of Dodge. You don't have to be an expert to see the signs coming and to start moving the rest of your coin to a hard wallet.

There are a ton of regulations about informed investing out there. The base ""tier"" in the US is being an accredited investor, which typically checks that income or non-primary-residence assets exceed a certain threshold before they'll let you invest in certain types of assets (hedge funds, real estate syndications, private equity, etc.). But there are higher classifications of investors above that, like qualified purchaser, eligible contract participant, and so on. I'm not well versed in the specifics here, but it seems entirely plausible to me that they opted to only offer bitcoin to folks who fall into one of those higher categories because it would give them fewer regulatory headaches at first, while also giving them first-mover PR advantage among big banks.

So basically I wouldn't read too much into it.

Scratch that. Something happened with the altcoin pairs on binance and made the price much lower. It appears that cmc calculates an average price.

2560,grd4tgb,t1_grcsvhi,"I guess, if they’re an aggregate site, it’s possible that they lost connection to one API and didn’t think to adjust the denominator for the loss, but put the value of that sites $/BTC at zero, skewing the average/aggregate. This happens when you let the computer decide to do, when you get a NULL return. If that wasn’t a clear hopeful this example will help:

Exchange A,B,C (3 exchanges) are all reporting 55k/BTC. So the average becomes (55k+55k+55k)/3=55k. Suddenly, connection drops to Exchange B, and the API returns “NULL” or possible “FALSE”. As the connection has dropped, the equation should change to (55k+55k)/2=55k (as the number of exchanges has now changed). But when you don’t code the appropriate handler for NULL or “False” returns, your script *could* interpret the return (or lack there of) as zero. This would result in an equation of (55k+0+55k)/3=36.667k. Of course the more exchanges you have, the smaller effect that zero would have on the average. As a side note, you can avoid this kind of error by counting your non-zero non-Null returns as using that as a denominator, instead of just deciding that the count of your array of exchanges is always going to be functional.

I have sold more BTC than I own and have just gotten over the regret. 

I did buy back in at a much higher price.  We can't change the past but we can change the future.  

I kept wishing I could tell my younger self to buy more BTC back in the early days.  Then I tried to listen what my future self was telling me what to do. The answer was ""Buy more BTC"" b/c with every central bank printing money BTC will become more valuable, Just like land, famous art, precious metals.

Risk/reward: Crypto is a better bet than cash, stocks and bonds.

It's about right now. Do many retail investors have huge liquidity to invest at these prices? No. If you think it's going to 200K you stand to make 4x on whatever investment you make. These people would be better served by a myriad of other investment products. But the fact that 1 coin is 50k and people are saying it'll be 200K -- they're losing sight of that simple arithmetic. 

I believe that Bitcoin is approaching saturation meaning that most people (who are available to play this game) have at least some idea of the thing. This is the height of that fervor.

I then am educated as to why it's more than that as you're saying.

I then discuss it as a revelatory new adaptation of the world which sees it replace our traditional financial system and render the subject-to-inflation-dollar (and friends) useless.

Then someone tells me that they'll never sell it and instead plan to take loans against their balance in their local currency.

Then another guy tells me that it is going to replace the current financial system and its problems despite the largest wallets being held by a very small number of people. The new 1%.

Then someone tells me I should listen to podcasts and watch content made by the whales as to why it is valuable and I am an idiot to not have...

And then the cycle goes on until you arrive.

So is it an investment, is it a replacement of fiat currency, is it a thing to hold indefinitely because it ""stores"" value (which I still disagree with although I understand how/why people are saying so), is it a short term rocket to 5/10/15x your money?

There's a lot of other coins, all serving different purposes, that you could look at as a potential replacement for currency. XLM comes to mind as a good replacement for currency, although it's primary purpose seems to be in low cost remittances from people back to relatives in their home country.

So even other coins are only replacements under certain circumstances. BATS are money for your attention to intermet ads. Civic is money that verifies your identity. There's even a coin that tracks and verifies the authenticity of wine bottles. Theres MANA which is like videogame money in a Minecraft like placed called Decentraland.

It is all so much more than you appear to be aware of which, no offense, makes your posts kind of suspect. Because I then wonder if you have time to write these ultra long arguments back and forth about what bitcoin really is, fighting like hell the idea it can keep going up without ever mentioning how much is up for grabs in the gold and bond markets, then asking if BTC is a replacement for currency (my answer is no cause of the energy requirements and fees, maybe for large cross border transactions), it makes me wonder how much you've actually researched crypto and DeFi in general.

No.  Only **you** are saying that the economy is going to crash and tying that to bitcoin.

Bitcoin is going to help the economy, because it's going to kill off unproductive debt creation to build houses that remain empty.

3077,gr9mhyk,t1_gr9d871,"Personally I feel like its all of these things to some extent- and it’s clearly different things to different people at different points in time. How do you value a global currency that could potentially revolutionize the entire financial system? What draws the line between speculation and reality? Are price prediction charts made in 2014 accurate simply because they exist and some people are aware of them or is their truth in the math/theory? I think there is a very subliminal battle that’s being fought with Bitcoin. With charts, graphs and comparing to growth of stocks- the media treats it like an investment. It can be used to grow wealth- and in turn, that is how it spreads right? But if the global financial system moved entirely to Bitcoin- would not all wealth generated be valued by the currency? It would in a sense be limitless- if that happens.

These are things I thought about immensely when I dove down the rabbit hole in May of 2017. Then last year Michael Saylor comes out reiterating a lot of these conclusions amongst many more, adding his own weight/gravity to the currency by owning billions. With numerous companies going large, educational courses being created, professional careers and positions opening up- I find it difficult to call it speculation outside of the moving 12-month price.",t3_m71eoe,2021-03-18 02:50:17,2021-03-18

I like the idea that it keeps everyone honest and you put your money in it and not worry about losing value, and not having to worry about what stocks to own- everyone just shares in a global pool of wealth. Just the transparency alone of where corporate funds, campaign donations and all the big money actually goes- that transparency and visibility alone is what I’m most hyped to see.",t3_m71eoe,2021-03-18 03:23:15,2021-03-18
