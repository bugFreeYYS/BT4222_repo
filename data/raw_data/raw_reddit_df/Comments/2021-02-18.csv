People calling them cultists, criminals, idiots who exchange real money for pet rocks, scammers, polluters. People telling them bitcoin has no value, can be copied, can be hacked, nobody needs it and on and on it goes.

An entire sub dedicated to mock bitcoiners for years.

News organizations repeatedly telling bitcoin going to die any minute now, Nobel prize winners and other Ivy League economists, politicians, the most richest people on the planet telling that they are pushing rat poison and worse.

Now that bitcoin value getting closer to $1 trillion market cap, Tesla, BlackRock and others joining the party, they just call bitcoiners 'lucky'.

Ask people you know to explain what Bitcoin is.

People over 40yo will generally not understand the technology at all. They will say: Gold is better (hello Peter). Others will say it will go to zero and is only a highly volatile instrument for speculation. Others will say it is a way for criminals to launder their money.

And the people under 40 will just say ""Oh Yes I wish I had bought some in 2010"" and ""oh yes Musk bought some and Bitcoin goes brrr brr""

How many of your friends and relatives can actually explain what a blockchain is and why it is revolutionary? (or a smart contract but this is not an ETH sub)

Have faith people, you're still early

**Edit:** I think the formulation of my post is a bit reductive and did not translate what I wanted to say:

I just point out that people who have heard about Bitcoin and deliberately choose not to invest even 100$ have different reasons not to do so. Those reasons differ with the age.

People who are older will tend to chastise Bitcoin because they do not understand the technology and therefore do not want to invest in it because of reasons I mentioned.(Look At Warren Buffet. He decided not to buy Microsoft because he did not understand why it would be game-changing. It does not make him a moron, he just did not want to dip his toe in unknown water)

People who are younger (and do not buy some) tend to see Bitcoin simply as a get-rich quick-its-going-to-the-moon thing. I remember people on Twitter complaining they bought Bitcoin in December 2017 and sold 2 months later as it dipped. They just wished it would double their investment quickly, but never really understood what is Bitcoin. I think those testimonies rebuked younger people from buying because the risk is too great. they just enjoy that some people are becoming millionaires suddenly and it makes great success stories that are ""fun""",t3_lmgdub,2021-02-18 19:19:07,2021-02-18

I guess a good analogy is when you try to convince an older person about the benefits of social media and the internet. They can’t understand how it fits into their world because they’re from a different world. 

You also have to realise that a lot of the people who have been against it are likely against it because it either negatively affects their personal belief system that they have had for decades, or it affects their income. For example, Peter Schiff suddenly coming out and saying that Bitcoin is better than gold and will eventually overtake it is probably not going to do any good for his gold business.

I think you're wrong.  People in their 20s can't explain it any better.  People over 40yo have serious money to dump in bitcoin. Look at most of the champions in the industry who are writing, speaking, investing, and you will see they are at least in their 30s and above. Don't make this an age-based, generational thing.

**Edit:**  I want to add one exception - Boomers.  Fucking boomers.  Generally speaking, they are selfish, stubborn, and stuck in their ways. They got wealthy off creating debt for younger generations.  So fuck them. But next in line is the X generation in their 40s and 50s and they are pretty solid -- quiet, hard working, and willing to put in the time to understand new technologies. And then the millenials, which can't be summed up yet because they are all over the map from hard-working to lazy and expecting entitlements.

We're still very early.  I'm in the ""right wing, fed is evil, buy gold crowd of generation x"".  No one in this crowd understands bitcoin.  For me it was a lightbulb moment, when we passed the old ath of 19k I knew I needed to figure out what it was.  It's the digitization of ""value"".  Not money.  Money was already digitized.

When all the bitcoins are mined, miners will be incentivised by a fee market to continue mining blocks.

1. Just yesterday I opened a LN wallet, but just to test an ""ad bot"" on telegram, and got two adds to pump doge lol, got paid 4 sats. Are this so called bots legit? Because it generated the address to me, and because if a test idc, but it is better that I make a wallet myself right? Because is like now that bot or the dev team there have access to it as well?
2. The LN as I understand works on top of bitcoin blockchain, does that mean that I can send a transaction from my wallet (segwit, nseg, or legacy, whatever) to my LN wallet?
3. Found this [https://getspendl.com/](https://getspendl.com/), looks great, someone actually uses it?
4. How can I fund a low amount LN wallet (like 100 sats)? Is it possible? I still have to pay the block fee when I send them in order to fund it right?

594,gnvfc91,t3_lmedy2,"Thanks for creating this dedicated thread again. As a 'LN-skeptic', in last week's Lightning Thursday thread I got a [brilliant answer explaining eclipse attacks](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lhl18h/lightning_thursday_february_11th_2021_explore_the/gn4a7bz/) from r/almkglor to my query about the possibility of cold storage for LN.

From my understanding of that*, my next question is:

If it would require access to the private keys of both participants of a LN channel (or something like an eclipse attack) to compromise the funds in a LN channel, does that make a LN (hot) wallet with all its funds in channels more secure than a standard hot wallet with its funds protected only by the keys in the one online device? And if so, isn't this a security feature of LN that would be worth highlighting?

Sure, it's not as secure as cold storage but surely its relative security to a standard wallet is also relevant?

624,gnv4qi4,t1_gnuz7o3,"I still don't think that this is something that is the primary use-case for lightning.  I expect the two main use-cases in the short to medium term are :

- Dollar cost averaging.

- Payments between friends (and dealers)

The credit card infrastructure is massive.  It works.  I can see credit/debit cards eventually allowing accounts where bitcoin is the unit of account just like the selection of different currencies at present.  You show your card, you tap it, and you pay on one of the hundreds of millions of terminals all around the world. But what you won't do is pay your dealer for a dime-bag.

The reason I think that dollar cost averaging is the key to lightning development is that it is the incentive for people to slowly accrete bitcoin in their lightning wallet over time.  This facilitates people spending those funds instantly via lightning when required.  When the channel gets filled from the DCA process, it sent as a chain transaction to cold storage, and the process of filling the channel begins again through DCA.

Lightning growth is organic just like bitcoin growth is organic.  Most of the medium to long term use-cases haven't even been thought of yet.  One thing for sure, it is so powerful that people haven't even really gotten their heads around it yet.",t3_lmedy2,2021-02-18 15:49:16,2021-02-18

For closed channels, the balance reflected by the closing transaction (after time-lock has passed) is the final settled balance amongst the channel parties.

For currently open channels (those with only opening TX on-chain, but no closing TX), the current balance distribution between the channel parties is not public by default, and the information is only stored by the parties themselves.

However, if anyone asks a channel party to prove the channel balance, they will be able to do that by simply replying with the transaction that reflects the current channel state.

Today in LN implementations (LND for example), you can mark a channel as ""public"", which means anybody can ask that channel's state, and you will give an answer proving it.

To be able to steal Alice's coins via the LN, Mallory would still have to control Alice's node in an ""online"" fashion, because Mallory would need to send an invoice to Alice's node and Alice's node would need to construct a payment route and correct transaction that make that invoice be paid.

So I believe an attack is needed with RCE capabilities (Remote Code Execution), whereas to steal funds on-chain a simple leak of the private keys is enough.",t3_lmedy2,2021-02-18 19:55:57,2021-02-18

If I have a channel open with some channel partner, I can broadcast a transaction and update the balance between the two of us since we mutually agree on a channel state. However, how does my channel partner ensure that only I am broadcasting these transactions? Is it my IP address/public key combo that identifies me to them? Surely there must be more to it than that, because otherwise anybody could spend my lightning funds. A private key must be involved somehow I'm just not sure how.

To other LN advocates here, is this something you're aware of and its implications too? Of all the posts raving on about LN that I've seen, none have been emphasizing this additional security element v. a normal hot wallet and if this is correct, I don't understand why?!

Wouldn't it make sense for those who want to push LN adoption / use, that you push the message to the majority who just speculate on Coinbase or wherever that if, as and when you're ready to control your keys and take your coins off-exchange, if it's a substantial sum, send it to cold storage (after dyor), but if it's a small amount, it's safer to create a LN wallet and move it to that (either with two fees or with none depending on the exchange) than it is to put it into a normal hot wallet?

I'm tempted to install a LN wallet on my phone and transfer to it the £100 odd worth in BTC that I have tended to keep there (topping up or taking out as necessary as I spend, receive and as the market goes up and down). I can still (if I'm prepared to pay 2 fees) close channels and send if necessary on chain but in the interim it's almost like holding a coin that has very limited vendor support and being able to send to friends only if they also have one. The key point is that my £100 worth of BTC in ln channels will be more secure than it is today :) - or have I misunderstood something?",t3_lmedy2,2021-02-18 21:16:52,2021-02-18

Which I think is fantastic.  But the amount that it is used in commerce is very small from what I can see.  I would expect that ln_strike would be the use-case that might markedly use this.  But even that is using it as a back-end process, not natively between users choosing to exhchange using lightning.

Which is fine.  I don't even think this is a problem.  I'm just saying the use of the protocol for payments as a chosen alternative over other options, is generally people making the decision to use lightning because they can, not because they have to.  Especially when those other options are freely available, most people simply choose the other options.

I know Taproot and Schnorr are coming and when fully implemented may mean a ~30% increase in block capacity. However, I am wondering whether the time to increase block size, not massively but at least to double capacity, has come.

I am not a fan but I think Lightning can't work if fees are $8-10 consistently. And that BTC adoption is increasing too fast for the network to cope with.

Also I believe we have gone a long way in terms of bandtwidth capacity and storage over the past decade.

And I am concerned about ossification of the network, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to make changes to BTC. And I think we still need quite a lot, in terms of anonimity and scalability.",t3_lmedy2,2021-02-18 19:59:03,2021-02-18

That's called PTEP (Pay to End Point).  I'm not actually sure what the status of that is right now.

It's important to understand what the primary use-case of lightning is right now.  For X person to pay Y and for there to be an agreement at that time that the payment is valid.  I'm not sure that's a major hurdle in the type of things I was talking about.  I think it just needs to be easy for a person to have a wallet that has the equivalent of $1.12, and for them to fund their game account by the equivalent of 27c.

A breez or phoenix wallet seems to already provide much of the functionality that you're talking about re: a permanent wallet.  But it is still a use-case issue.",t3_lmedy2,2021-02-18 16:17:06,2021-02-18

761,gnvm2ue,t1_gnvl4nq,"I agree partially with your fee concerns, especially w.r.t. fees maybe being too high for a force-close or punishment transaction. This might reduce the relative security of LN when compared to on-chain.

However for ""normal"" (consensual) channel openings and closures, I expect them to be somewhat infrequent events for any regular LN user. You might open/close a channel once every two months, for example. Since these event are infrequent, it should be not a big deal to pay a smaller fee and have to wait one or two days for opening/closing.

If you want a channel fast, you will have to pay more. But in that case, you probably are wanting a bigger channel anyways, so the opening fees will make up a relatively smaller part of the channel's capacity.",t3_lmedy2,2021-02-18 20:11:44,2021-02-18

In the meantime, I think of the fee pressure as an optimization mechanism for bitcoin. It forces people and services to adopt best practices (native segwit address, batching, coin selection etc), which is a good thing. This angle might be helpful to be a bit more relaxed about the high fees.

But agree with you with ossification of the code... I don't know how long is the window for the community to agree to a hardfork change such as a block size increase, in a few decades or even a few years it might be impossible to do.",t3_lmedy2,2021-02-18 20:06:21,2021-02-18

Since their finances seemed so intertwined, any investment would have had to enjoy her blessing. That's why it is called a partnership.

Everyone in the comments here saying the dude was at fault, you’re only getting her version of the story. You don’t know if the guy had a gambling problem or if she’s exaggerating.

Fast forward to now & not a single person actually buys Bitcoin to use it as a currency, but rather as an asset they hope to hodl & gain value in. It’s not really a currency because no one is willing to actually use it as such. Everyone wants to just hodl & watch the price go up.

""so i would suggest making an ultimatum, couples counseling or divorce, his choice.
This counseling should focus on the idea (which the name escapes me here) but in gambling, when someone loses, they actually have the idea that they need to put in more money in order to recoup the loss. At this point your SO is prolly so far in the hole that he is hoping and rationalizing with himself that the price will go up. Otherwise, he is wrong, and not just the simple kind of wrong but the ""i have fucked up so badly that our finances and nest egg are now gone....wrong""

that's a huge burden to face, in fact, it's just way easier to get lost in the concept and hope that one day the price will go to the moon and everything will be okay because that's a better thought.

the cold hard truth is that bitcoin absolutely will continue to plummet down to nothing. And this is a finance person speaking here (CPA actually) but the REASONS why are the following: (and this has never been rebutted when ever I bring it up)

1) bitcoin is a currency, or at least it tries to be a currency, however in order for a currency to be taken seriously it needs to stay flat against other currencies. No smart company would ever consider BTC because of this. because when you sell something for $10 BTC, worth $1,000USD and 5 minutes later your coins are now worth $800 or $1,200 it's just too damn volatile. Companies hate hedging againt movements of 1-3% why would they ever want to make that even harder?

2) I said no smart companies, there are a few companies out there accepting it, and a bunch of small businesses, but these guys are just hunting for money because BTC made some people a lot of money last year. Best guess is these companies will begin to drop BTC payment in the next year as the well runs dry.

He squandered a vacation fund to buy more bitcoin without telling her? That's a dick move, even if you believed in this shit wholeheartedly ahead of the curve.

Edit: Also I'll assume worst case. She mentions losing 22k, so assume that's what he spent and it was all in 2014 at its highest at around 500 a coin that year. He'd have about 44 coins worth 2.3 million today.

---

the cold hard truth is that bitcoin absolutely will continue to plummet down to nothing. And this is a finance person speaking here (CPA actually) but the REASONS why are the following: (and this has never been rebutted when ever I bring it up)

1) bitcoin is a currency, or at least it tries to be a currency, however in order for a currency to be taken seriously it needs to stay flat against other currencies. No smart company would ever consider BTC because of this. because when you sell something for $10 BTC, worth $1,000USD and 5 minutes later your coins are now worth $800 or $1,200 it's just too damn volatile. Companies hate hedging againt movements of 1-3% why would they ever want to make that even harder?

2) I said no smart companies, there are a few companies out there accepting it, and a bunch of small businesses, but these guys are just hunting for money because BTC made some people a lot of money last year. Best guess is these companies will begin to drop BTC payment in the next year as the well runs dry.

I liquidated 3000 USD of crypto in November to leave her, and I'd be 20,000 - 22,000 USD richer (and more inclined to take care of her debt) now if I didn't feel the need to leave her.",t3_lm9noh,2021-02-18 11:45:49,2021-02-18

With inflation going the way it is, locking in a piece of the world's most scarce asset at a fixed cost, sounds pretty good to me.

As time goes on, the homeowner renting to you, who has a fixed cost will keep raising your rent. You'll never catch up, you'll spend more and at the end of the day, you'll own nothing.

3521,gnvv75n,t1_gnvuvbn,"I'll paste my earlier response here so I don't have to write it again. 

For the sake of simplicity... If you bought a house for 120,000, lived in it for 10 years, and had an average of 1,000 a month in all utilities insurance, etc., then you not only paid 120,000 for the house, but you also paid 120,000 to live in it like a civilized human being. The real cost of that house was 240,000. If you lived in it for 20 years, the real cost would be 360,000. And I'm not even counting all the miscellaneous things we spend money on to maintain, upgrade the house, or even the property tax. If you can't sell the house for at least 360,000 or more then you won't even break even on your ""investment"". That is a liability all the way to the end. And that's fine. You just need to recognize that it doesn't belong in the asset column, and treat it as such.",t3_lmdmqs,2021-02-18 21:51:32,2021-02-18
3522,gnvrfkg,t1_gnvqwfl,"Is it currently putting money in your pocket while it's taking money out? By the way, have you ever added up 10 years of utility bills, maintenance, property tax, insurance, etc.? You might find it interesting when you compare it to how much you bought the house for. 

It's very very simple: if it's bringing in more money than it's taking out, it's an asset. If it takes more money than it's bringing in, it's a liability. That applies to everything.",t3_lmdmqs,2021-02-18 21:14:18,2021-02-18

I have a problem with this for a couple reasons. First off, the problem with artificial market manipulations are that they are artificial market market manipulations- whether its manipulation on the supply side or demand side. It doesn’t make it okay when someone other than the Fed is doing it. 

Second I do not think it is accurate, nor appropriate to imply that demand for BTC is artificial. I don’t know about the rest of you- but with options like interest bearing custodial accounts, the ability to borrow against my hodlings, and DeFi smart contacts that can essentially replicate most commercial banking services- not to mention crypto debit and credit cards- I will never not own crypto. 

I’m not hodling to “artificially pump the price of Bitcoin up so i can sell it all and make a huge windfall”...I’m hodling because I have a valuable asset that is a financial tool capable of doing things fiat currency cannot.

The ice machine on my Samsung fridge broke. After investigating, I found all Samsung Ice makers on my model break, repeatedly. I could spend $500 to fix it, and then fix it again in a year or two, or I could spend $250 on a portable ice machine that makes Sonic-style nugget ice.

Alts are near their all time lows vs Bitcoin right now. For instance, if we assume someday that EOSBTC will retrace even just 50% back to its ATH against bitcoin, it’s current price at .0001 is like buying bitcoin at $5000 or so.

Bitcoin is expensive right now, but alts are not. Imagine bitcoin is going to 230k right now. That’s about a 400% increase from the current price, so you could maybe multiply your investment by 4. If we look at EOSBTC again, if it hits retraces **just halfway** back to its ATH it will have increased about 1000%.

Hi guys,

So here is the thing: I could use some thoughts on how to ""get rid"" of my BTCs. The BTC 🚀 is about to rise from ATH to ATH. I am holding BTC since 2019, making a nice profit now. 
My plan is to get more BTC in future, without spending more money. Meaning, selling at high, getting back in on a dip. I have the feeling that the air is getting thinner and a correction is overdue at some point. No one knows when. So what do you think is a good strategy of selling and reinvesting my btc's? 
In an ideal world, i would sell right before the highest high and come back at the low - but hitting those points is almost impossible. So I need a strategy to manage that, without dying of FOMO 😳😅

In Jan 2018 it tanked all the way back to 10K and I felt like an idiot for getting in during the ATM bubble and for not selling what I had instead.

But I didn't sell then either, not even my original BTC I bought in at 4K which would have been more than enough to recover my loss. Instead I just kept buying a bit of BTC every now and then, never sold anything.

Today, I'm selling those first few BTC I bought at 4K, as well as some of what I bought in 2018 in the 8K range, and using that money to set a big juicy down payment on my dream house.

The moral of the story is patience. Don't get into BTC expecting to become a millionaire. Don't get into any ""investment"" expecting to see massive gains in the short term. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Don't panic sell during the dips, and buy instead.

4593,gnukh17,t1_gnsj44z,"I'm starting to think of what will happen if I actually miss selling enough at the top - like if I only get less than 25% sold and it peaks.  I don't think I will care this time - even in the face of an 80% RESET (which will probably be more like 60% or 70% this time) from the peak will still be so high that I'm in an exponential strong hand position from my entry.  It will be like any NORMAL pullback on a 10 year up-trend.  And I've been holding SILVER - so if anyone can be patient watching glaciers flow, its me...   As long as the trend is still UP after that, I'm actually thinking - I will HOLD a core position even if it tops at 300K (not 600K+).  And only sell maybe up to 25 to 30%.  I'm too worried about having none left if it doubles two more times after my last sell..  So I'd almost rather hold through another 80% dip and add back some of my proceeds I sold with - once its down 60% I will know I'm for certain in the reset and not in a bullish pullback - and then I can mount an offense from the next bear market bottom - and possibly trade it during the accumulation / re-accumulation cycle the way I should have done this past time.  I missed the sell at 13K up from my entry at 4K (in 6 months) because I was too afraid to miss further upside.  This time I know better - the accumulation cycle takes TIME and until that time is done its a range trade...  Next time I will capitalize on the volatility of that bear market cycle and keep repositioning until at least 3/4 of the cycle is over - by which time I'll remain loaded up for the bull cycle.",t3_llx853,2021-02-18 12:00:13,2021-02-18

It's still in the top three holdings.. if Coke hadnt performed well or got hit with a scandal like law suits for decaying teeth which could have happened... his wealth today may not have been as notable as it is.

I recommend everybody follow Yeonmi park and watch the video.  But for anybody at work/who can't listen to her I wrote down what she says : 

When Kim Jong Un was transitioning into power citizens were told to change all their old north korean won into new north korean won.

BUT the maximum they were allowed to exchange was 10,000 won - the remainder they were told to deposit into north korean banks, BUT withdrawal from north korean banks is illegal.

People responded by burning their currency.  Some people also committed suicide.  (Suicide is illegal in North Korea - the government will punish your family by restricting jobs and marriage availability to your surviving relatives)

She talks about how North Koreans need assets to pay to escape.  She talks about how she needed a small amount of cash to escape North Korea.

**She suggests that if your life depends upon it, North Koreans could easily memorize the bitcoin seed/private key and escape with those assets without risk of North Korea seizing them.**


Interesting suggestion/human rights implications that I haven't heard elsewhere...",t3_lmka6s,2021-02-18 19:12:02,2021-02-18

I can recite it now months later, check my metal storage and it’s exact. 

And I think if I were to pass through a border or customs with my metal device and wallet, I would zero out the metal device to do that. And feel totally comfortable with that.

Some sites explain it poorly; this was the tutorial I used:
