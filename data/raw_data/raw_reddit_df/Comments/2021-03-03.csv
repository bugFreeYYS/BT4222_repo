80,gpfxg54,t1_gpel4q1,"Good question. I've written about it previously here:

https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/9144bd57a91c194e332fb5ca371d0964#how-are-coinswap-and-lightning-network-different

The gist is that CoinSwap is fundamentally an on-chain technology while Lightning is off-chain. Bitcoin needs on-chain privacy as well, otherwise the bad privacy can leak into layer-2 solutions. That also means CoinSwap is better for larger amounts while LN is better for smaller amounts. Also CoinSwap is likely to have stronger sybil resistance than LN.",t3_lm6nmk,2021-03-03 02:29:51,2021-03-03

That was CoinJoin not CoinSwap. And yes I agree it bad, hopefully CoinSwap will be much harder to block because its very un-obvious that a given transaction is or isnt a CoinSwap. CoinJoin's by contrast as much more obvious, and so surveillance companies easily detect them and rate them as ""higher risk"".",t3_lm6nmk,2021-03-03 07:08:54,2021-03-03

*buy at year 0, never sell*

is going to make you much more money than buying every dip and selling every peak.

It's SF, so it's likely a Chinese owner. If it were SoCal it would definitely be a Korean owner. 

With that said, place looks meh for a sushi spot... there is fucking siracha on the table FFS! 

But lord knows we all dropped coin in places like that back then just to prove it could be done when ever possible and gave some to anons as well just to have a story to tell when they got back home and looked up this place and BTF.

Staff night out, that's low ball (budgeted meal, with no paid alcohol/drinks) at an ok spot to be honest.

They sent the entire downstairs menu twice and they were apparently so coked out they couldn't stop doing stupid shit on their phones and eat like functional human beings.

What's funny is the corpo staff dropped over 50k at a buy out party for someone's 15th year anniversary the day after that, I was there for that one, and front of house served them several day old bottles of wine from the night before and they never realized it... corpos are all the same, they'll drink whatever you tell them is 'high class' in a 'pretty bottle' even if it tastes off. I wanted to see if we could give them the box wine we use on the line at last call to see if they'd notice. We hosted so many FAANG buy outs.
