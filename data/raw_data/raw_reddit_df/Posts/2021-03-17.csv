0,Decentralization-Boosting Mining Protocol Stratum V2: Overview & Progress Update,326,m16uon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m16uon/decentralizationboosting_mining_protocol_stratum/,132,2021-03-09 21:54:44,"Over the past year, we've explained many benefits of the Stratum V2 mining protocol **for miners, pools, and the Bitcoin network as a whole**. Now it's time for a recap & update on development + adoption 👇

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 & BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners & mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

>[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ⬇️

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",2021-03-09

4,Warning: STOP buying Bitcoin on Robinhood. These guys almost went under to a 3b margin call on illegal $GME paper trades. They will rob you and go broke.,228,m7bmr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m7bmr1/warning_stop_buying_bitcoin_on_robinhood_these/,44,2021-03-18 05:49:26,"If this applies to you, seriously what are you thinking? We’ve been shouting “don’t buy BTC on RH” from the rooftops. The latest update is finding out that RH has admitted to paper trading $GME and fucking investors when their naked positions caught a 3 billion dollar margin call.

If this has been a Bitcoin related event, there would have been no recovery, RH would have filed for bankruptcy and relied on their elite friends to manage any government intervention that may crop up.

 RH basically shorted every order their client’s made, not only stabbing those clients in the back short term, but setting them up to lose everything if they were right. If $GME had gone to $1,000 all of these folks would have been left with less than their buy-in because RH would have gone under.

Returning to Bitcoin, it’s important to understand that this deceptive practice is even more easily perpetrated against RH’s BTC buyers and that Congress / regulators are even less likely to do anything about it.

For the love of Satoshi, I know at least one of you reading this is still not selling the Bitcoin you have on RH, transferring your fiat to a legitimate exchange, rebuying the Bitcoin, and storing it off exchange. Stupid games, stupid prizes, and you can’t be entirely dumb if you’ve read this far. Make the move right now and sleep better knowing your coins are safe and Sonos the integrity of the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

Other exchanges to consider include: Gemini, Kraken, Binance US, Coinsebase Pro, Swan, and if you’re a real legend BISQ. 

If this is your first time hearing this stuff, search r/Bitcoin for Robinhood and checkout this recent r/wallstreetbets thread detailing RH’s 3 billion dollar margin call https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m74e3g/this_is_huge_robinhood_never_owned_your_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

TL:DR - RH probably isn’t buying Bitcoin when you buy Bitcoin on RH. If Bitcoin rallies hard enough, or if RH has an internal problem, you’re likely to lose everything. Move your funds off of RH.",2021-03-18

9,Bitcoin's fair launch cannot ever be replicated by another cryptocurrency,98,m79l3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m79l3c/bitcoins_fair_launch_cannot_ever_be_replicated_by/,38,2021-03-18 04:17:58,"I created this thread to point out some distinct and important differences between the launch of bitcoin compared to the launch of every other cryptocurrency. I realize that many of you already know these facts, but some of you don't.

Bitcoin, the most secure and decentralized cryptocurrency (I'm not debating it), was created to solve the problem of trust with governments and to be a store of value that can be sent/received anywhere/anytime without permission or trust of anyone else. Bitcoin’s narrative matches the real world utility. If you want to get technical, bitcoin is really a scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked. 

**To ensure that the launch was considered fair, Satoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that bitcoin was launched fairly:**

- **No premine** (Satoshi didn’t grant himself any coins)
- **Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network** (no sudden release and no mining before release)
- **Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely** (this cannot even be replicated)
- **Satoshi never cashed out** (unlike every other founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)

Putting everything else about bitcoin aside, there will never be another cryptocurrency that is launched as fairly as bitcoin, for all of eternity, because bitcoin's fair launch cannot ever be replicated. Now that the genies out of the bottle and bitcoin is here, it's 100% impossible to ever have a cryptocurrency where the coins are circulating in the wild freely for 18 months before having any value. I also don't think that we'll ever see another cryptocurrency created where the founder never cashes out.",2021-03-18

$1M Bitcoin most likely means the dollar has significantly deteriorated in value. Think about all your friends and family who do not own Bitcoin. Their wages and savings are now worth a fraction of what they were before. At the same time, cost of living and assets have gone up, so not only is their money worth less, it can't buy as much. Some of them know you own, and maybe start asking for help. Some of these people might be the same ones who laughed at you for buying in the first place. It's easy to say, ""You should've listened to me"" but they're hurting. You don't want to see them hurt.

Maybe the non-coiners start blaming the crypto community for this new state of affairs. It would be wrong, but someone needs to take the fall. Central banks might pile on to this blame game, too. That, in turn, motivates politicians to do the same. Maybe they try to push a crypto ban. But at this point there's so much institutional money in the game it makes a ban tough to rationalize -- especially with all their big money campaign contributors. So they demonize it instead. They say that Bitcoin is unpatriotic, anti-society, greedy, selfish... etc. They can't stop Bitcoin but they can certainly try and push it to the margins, into the underground and out of the mainstream economy. Bitcoin now has a negative stigma. Doing business in crypto becomes significantly harder. It's not clear who you can talk to about this anymore. Maybe this pushes the price up? Maybe it pushes it down?

Meanwhile, some countries embrace crypto and become crypto havens with progressive crypto laws. These are great places to live if you own crypto but the cost of living in these places is dramatically higher than non-crypto places because all coiners want to move there. Your Bitcoin is still good but it can't buy as much as you like. And maybe these crypto enclaves have higher rates of crypto-related theft because criminals know it's a target-rich environment. Sure crypto is easier to live off of, but you have to be on high-alert all the time to protect your assets and your physical safety.

... like I said, not intended to be FUD. I just think there are too many positive narratives floating around related to Bitcoin's price skyrocketing and not enough consideration of the larger economic landscape in a world where BTC has mooned.

I'm starting to see more and more overjoyed responses across the cryptosphere of people sharing articles like Visa and Mastercard, Paypal etc integrating more crypto and bringing it mainstream. While I'm really glad to see crypto finally pushing through the barriers that were placed in front of it, I can't help wonder what potential ramifications could take place.

The *first sentence* of the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) says the following:

> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution 

I'm concerned about financial institution's involvement and their desire to control assets, especially those like bitcoin which they've been fighting tooth and nail over for a decade. With the massive influx of institutional money, where does that leave us? I'm not necessarily against it, but I hate to see bank get involved in the first place. Perhaps I'm an outlier, and realistically I'm not sure I see other ways of pushing adoption. Is this something to worry over or what?

E.g., I'm referring to announcements like [this](https://decrypt.co/61738/visa-is-working-to-enable-bitcoin-purchases-ceo) where Visa openly says they're trying to facilitate those purchases for people, basically being the intermediate we were trying to get rid of.",2021-03-18
