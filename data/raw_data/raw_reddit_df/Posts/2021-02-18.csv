4,How Bitcoin saved my life.,166,ln21zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ln21zu/how_bitcoin_saved_my_life/,53,2021-02-19 08:37:57,"&#x200B;

I posted this on another subreddit, and its gotten a lot of response. Just thought I'd share it here so newcomers can see how I used DCA strategy to invest in Bitcoin monthly  over the last 8 years.

&#x200B;

I'm a taxi driver in a European city and in December 2012 I picked up an American customer who wanted to go to the airport. The traffic was chaotic and what would usually be a 30 min journey, took approx 90 min. He was cool with it though, as he had plenty of time for his flight.

We had a really good chat, he told me about BTC and how even if I didn't want to put money into it, it was important to know what it was. Needless to say, I was intrigued, and a bit confused. Over the next ten days or so, I read as much online as I could and decided there and then that I would quit my 15 cigarettes a day habit and put the money I would have spent otherwise into BTC. I made my first purchase of BTC on Jan 1st, 2013.

Every month for the last 8 years, I have bought €250 of BTC. I was DCAing without even realising it was an actual strategy. I am still buying at today's price, and have bought at every price range since 2013. I have never sold any of it.

Needless to say, my financial and physical health have drastically changed since then and I truly believe that BTC has saved my life. My initial plan was to DCA for 10 years, and if I have enough to retire, then I will, that's less than 2 years away now and will be 1 month before my 40th birthday.

I have well over 7 figures in BTC, yet still drive my taxi everyday. Life is good.

&#x200B;

Edit: Just wanted to add in that Bitcoin gave me an incentive to quit smoking, and that's as valuable to me as the gains I've made. That's why I feel it saved my life.",2021-02-19

They would never have bought any if it wasn't for the etf. What a great way for everyday investors to buy bitcoin and not have to worry about exchange fees, wallets, keys, custody, etc. Not only for retail investors but also companies, pension funds etc.

The fact that people can now hold it long term in tax saving accounts and retirement plans is amazing and will truly change everything. In fact, any new buys will probably be through the etf personally.

I know a lot of people here lean to the libertarian side (myself included) and will state, ""not your keys, not your coins"", but honestly, 99% of people are going to buy to hedge against inflation and invest in this new finance instrument and aren't trying to screw central banks.

She goes off on a diatribe and mocks him every chance he gets for his ""foolish"" beliefs and how he spends his money on buying and holding bitcoin... she consider any bitcoin that he holds to be ""lost money"".

I actually saved this when I read it back years ago to see one day how it would age... man talk about the worlds biggest I told you so. She had zero faith and respect in her husband. I hope he has a garage full of lambos in his giant mansion.

Here are some of the highlights  snipped for your own entertainment:

\-------

&#x200B;

""My husband (I'll call him John for the sake of anonymity) and I have been married for a little over 5 years now and everything has been going well up until a year or so ago. We were planning on having children and everything. Now my life feels like it is at a complete stand still.""

Skip to 2013...

"" We are both avid redditors so when we find a new subreddit that we love we get excited and start sending each other links to see if we can get the other one interested  He finds out about bitcoin and is sending me links constantly about it.  (r/bitcoin) It goes from ""check out this cool technology"" to absolute cultish behavior in a very brief period. I would say 0-100 in probably 2 months. He starts taking every dime we have and buying them as quickly as he can. **He actually set up a feature that BUYS MORE ON A WEEKLY BASIS** after our paychecks come through. The worst part is he didn't even TELL ME he did this. He gave me this arrogant response about doing what's best for us and our future kids.

Overall, and I'm not exaggerating, I would say **we have lost over $22,000.** I kept telling him to sell as the price was rising and he promised me a big year in 2014. **The price kept falling and he CONTINUED TO BUY MORE.**  He makes more money than I do but we are building a future together and we have a shared bank account. He kept telling me this was for our kids college fund, to buy a house, etc. The money...I can get over as people spend money on other stupid crap like boats they will never use but this isn't even the beginning to the absolute craziness I will see out of him over the coming year.

My husband starts bringing up fucking bitcoin at these events. MY events for MY job. People here have a lot of money and he knows this. He saw this as some kind of opportunity. He goes on and on about how taxes are theft and bitcoin is a way out. The dollar is about to collapse, banks are destroying the world, etc. You are supposed to make light hearted jokes about how their football team is doing, not get into these political discussions. He knows this too since he's been coming to these events with me for years.

It starts off small where I laugh it off and say ""ohhhh John, he's into technology and gets a little too excited"". He saw this as condescension. The car rides home? Full on fights about how **I don't get it and I'm going to be left behind.** I felt like I was fighting with some type of evangelical Christian (I have been in plenty of these growing up). He ironically rips into religion any chance he gets but he is **absolutely part of a cult full of insane people.**

Keep in mind as this goes on he is still buying more as the **price goes down telling me we have a great opportunity on our hands**.  He ignores long term trends and focuses on these specific time frames to show me how stupid I am. Yes, my husband called me STUPID over THINKING I do not understand it.

I feel like I have read more about bitcoin than he has because he won't discuss any downsides with me. He tells me all problems will be fixed and **we are in on the ground floor**. He seems to be in a constant good news bubble about this **when no one actually cares**. Most of the responses he gets from people in public are feigned interest until they can get away from him or they just tell him they don't care if the converstaion lasts more than 2 minutes. **I am embarrassed to be around him.**

After a **recent price crash, he actually bought more using our vacation fund** that I have been saving away for AND planning. **All gone, in bitcoin never to be seen again.**

I am sorry for the long rant but this is my life now. I have tried everything. I have tried reasoning with him. I have tried explaining to him that he should not have sole control over our money. **He is so confident that he slyly brings up selling one of our cars to buy more**. He didn't come right out and say what it was for but I can guarantee you it was to buy more. He is ruining my job and **robbing me of happiness.**

I used to consider him a smart guy and **I never, ever thought he would succomb to basically being brainwashed by a bunch of clueless idiots on the internet who seem to know absolutely nothing about finance or the real world (**r/bitcoin**).** I don't know how familiar people are here with bitcoin but if you go to their subreddit, you will see exactly what I'm talking about. I started crying once reading my husband's comments worded slightly differently, repeated 100 times over. It was like I married a parrot.

What do I DO? I am not religious in any way but my family most certainly is. **I feel like I couldn't even bring up divorce and I want to save my husband.** I want him back to the way he was. It seems like he is addicted to a drug but since he doesn't realize it, everyone else is wrong. I don't know if I should have an intervention or just walk away and hope he comes to his senses when **I'm staying in a hotel for a few weeks.**

Again, I apologize for the length but I want you to feel the way I feel so you can understand the advice you are giving. I really need help here. Thank you to anyone who even reads half of this!

You can simply leave it here on Reddit and take all the time you need to learn about and understand the lightning network, then you can come back here and withdraw it when you’re comfortable.

Otherwise you can jump right in and download a lightning enabled bitcoin wallet!

Here are some wallets I recommend;

Bluewallet - https://bluewallet.io
Zap - https://zaphq.io
Wallet of Satoshi - https://www.walletofsatoshi.com

There are more Lightning wallets available but I’ll just start with recommending these 3.

Now what you want to do is create a Lightning wallet within the app, I’ll be using bluewallet as an example.

Once you open bluewallet you want to create a new wallet and make sure you are selecting “Lightning” as the wallet type. Then simply just tap receive and create an “invoice” for however many satoshis you wish to withdraw from lntip bot.

Once you have your invoice copied you just simply need to message u/lntipbot with the following

!withdraw (INVOICE GOES HERE)

(Make sure to remove the brackets)

then simply send that as a message and instantly your satoshis will be sent to your lightning wallet!

I personally use White Flour but I'm sure you could substitute Whole Wheat Flour with Fantastic Results.
Oh and I forgot to mention that the batter after being mixed together can be refridgerated for up to a week and can be frozen after being cooked for upto a month!

As For Pictures, I'll Put Some Up As Soon As I Get Some Eggs.

I was also thinking of maybe boxing them up and selling them, as a near-instant pancake mix.
Does anyone know what kind of red tape i have to go through to do that?

Anything to do with food and you really wanna make sure you don't get sued. If you accidentally ship the mix with a rusty nail in it and someone dies, that's bad.

Anyhow, PM me with the recipe and an address and I'll have a go at it (the pancakes, not the litigation).

My pancake recipe is still for sale, only 2 people so far want to try them.
I understand the argument,

""Why would I spend a quarter on something that I can find on the Internet for Free?""

And I would Reply:

""How could you miss a chance to have the BEST PANCAKES EVER, just because it cost a quarter""

I lump sump buy BTC - DCA is for boomers. 

I have more than 5% of my net worth into BTC. 

Guess fucking what? I tripled my NOV investments where I bought in at $17k

I doubled my investments in Dec where I bought in at an average of 25k. 

I’m a goddamn idiot investor and bitcoin works for me. 

Secret to my success. Never:
- day trade or try to time the market
- panic sell. I goddamn HODL (since 2015)

I’ve been working my fingers to the bone for years as a nurse and this whole COVID is making me inch closer to my breaking point. I’m late to the game, but I’ve been putting as much as I can into Bitcoin but it’s not much. 

Honestly if I could start all over, I think I would be happy building my own startup mining company, and build something with my two hands. It’s so hard to see ahead and just live deliberately with everything going on. 

This community is vibrant and helpful and I will be a permanent lurker. Even though I’m late and will never be a whale, it was nice to be a part of it.

I really think Bitcoin is going to change the world, and for the better.
