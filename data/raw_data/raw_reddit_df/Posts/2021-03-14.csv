I didn’t understand the markets then and held through the peaks and ended up in the bear market thinking I lost it all. But I held. Fast forward to now. I stupidly still never put anything into BTC because I’ve been waiting for LTC to catch up. I now realize that I need to move the majority of my holdings into btc for stability, but I can’t decide when to do that or even how. The best scenario I can come up with is hoping LTC goes parabolic after PayPal crypto merchant payments is launched later this month, then sell into GUSD and wait for the bear market to put it into BTC.
